I decide to create this repo to add samples for the main Design Patterns

## Creational Patterns

Ways to create objects while hiding the creation logic.

## Structural Patterns

Deal with class and object composition and use inheritance to compose interfaces and objects for functionality.

## Behavioral Patterns

Perform communications between objects.
