# Observer Pattern


Bullet points
 - The observer pattern defines a one-to-many relationship between objects.
 - Subjects, or as we also know them, Observables, update Observers using a common interface.
 - Observers are loosely coupled in that the Observable knows nothing about them, other than that they implement the Observer interface.
 - You can push or pull data from the Observable when using the pattern (pull is considered more “correct”).
