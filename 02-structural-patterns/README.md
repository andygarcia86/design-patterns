# Structural Patterns

Deal with class and object composition and use inheritance to compose interfaces and objects for functionality.

 - Adapter: Match interfaces of different classes.
 - Bridge: Separate an object's interface from its implementation.
 - Composite: A tree structure of simple composite objects.
 - Decorator: Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically.
 - Facade: A single class that represents an entire subsystem.
 - Flyweight: A fine-grained instance using for efficient sharing.
 - Proxy: An object representing another object.
