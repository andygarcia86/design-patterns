# Facade Pattern

The Facade Pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

## Bullet points
 - When you need to use an existing class and its interface is not the one you need, use the adapter pattern.
