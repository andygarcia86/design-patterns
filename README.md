# Design Patterns

I decide to create this repo to add samples for the main Design Patterns

## Creational Patterns

Ways to create objects while hiding the creation logic.

 - Abstract Factory: Creates an instance of several families of classes.
 - Builder: Separates object construction from its representation.
 - Factory Method: Creates an instance of several derived classes.
 - Prototype: A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned.
 - Singleton: A class of which only a single instance can exist.

## Structural Patterns

Deal with class and object composition and use inheritance to compose interfaces and objects for functionality.

 - Adapter: Match interfaces of different classes.
 - Bridge: Separate an object's interface from its implementation.
 - Composite: A tree structure of simple composite objects.
 - Decorator: Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically.
 - Facade: A single class that represents an entire subsystem.
 - Flyweight: A fine-grained instance using for efficient sharing.
 - Proxy: An object representing another object.

## Behavioral Patterns

Perform communications between objects.

 - Chain of Responsibility: A way of passing a request between a chain of objects.
 - Command: Encapsulate a command request as an object.
 - Interpreter: A way to include language elements in a program.
 - Iterator: Sequentially access the elements of a collection.
 - Mediator: Defines simplified communication between classes.
 - Memento: Capture and restore the object's internal states.
 - Observer: A way of notifying change to a number of classes.
 - State: Alters an object's behavior when its state change. 
 - Strategy: Encapsulate an algorithm inside a class.
 - Template Method: Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a sub class.
 - Visitor: Defines a new operation to a class without change.
